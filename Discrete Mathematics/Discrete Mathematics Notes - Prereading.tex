\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Set notation}
\textbf{Basic notation}

A set is defined by the elements that belong to the set.

If an element $x$ belongs to a set $S$, we write $x \in S$.

Finite or countably infinite sets are those which we can write as a (finite or infinite) list, such as
\[
S = \{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n\},
\]
(a finite set, with elements labelled by finitely many integers) or
\[
S = \{e_1, e_2, e_3, \dots\},
\]
(representing a countably infinite set, with elements labelled by all positive integers).

The order of elements in a set is unimportant.

A set can be described using the following notation
\[
S = \{n: n \text{ is an integer}, 0\leq n \leq 9\}
\]
which means all $n$ such that the properties to the right of the '$:$' hold.

\textbf{Examples of standard sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Z = \{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots\} = \{0, \pm1, \pm2, \dots\}$, the set of integers (whole numbers).
    \item $\N = \{1, 2, \dots\} = \{n: n\in\Z, n>0\}$, the natural numbers (positive integers).
    \item $\emptyset = \{\}$ is the empty set (the set with no elements).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{More notation}

As mentioned before, $x \in S$ means element $x$ is a member of the set $S$. The negation is $x \notin S$.

If $R$ and $S$ are sets, then $R \subseteq S$ means that $R$ is a subset of $S$, i.e., every element of $R$ is also an element of $S$. That is, for all $x;\ x \in R \implies x \in S$.

Note that $R = S$ if and only if $R \subseteq S$ and $S \subseteq R$.

$R \subset S$ is used to denote that $R$ is a strict subset of $S$, meaning $R \subseteq S$ and $R \neq S$.

If $S$ is a finite set, its size or cardinality, denoted by $|S|$, is the number of elements that it contains.


\textbf{Set operations}

Given several sets $A$ and $B$, $A \cup B$ is the union of $A$ and $B$, which is the set consisting of those elements that are in $A$ or in $B$ (or both)

$A \cap B$ is the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, which is the set consisting of those elements that are in both $A$ and $B$.

If two sets $A$ and $B$ do not intersect ($A \cap B = \emptyset$) we say that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint.

A collection of sets can be indexed by numbers, e.g. $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$.

Then we may use compact notation for multiple unions and intersections:
\begin{align*}
    \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n}{A_i} &= A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n \\
    &= \{x: x \in A_i \text{ for at least one } i\};
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    \bigcap_{i = 1}^{n}{A_i} &= A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots \cap A_n \\
    &= \{x: x \in A_i \text{ for every } i\};
\end{align*}

\textbf{Cartesian products}

If $X$ and $Y$ are two sets, their Cartesian product is
\[
X \times Y = \{(x, y): x \in X \text{ and } y \in Y\},
\]
the set of all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ with first component in $X$ and second in $Y$.

For example, if $X = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $Y = \{a, b\}$, then the set $X \times Y$ is
\[
\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\},
\]
while the set $Y \times X$ is
\[
\{(a, 1), (a, 2), (a, 3), (b, 1), (b, 2), (b, 3)\}.
\]

\section{Arrangements and permutations}

\subsection{Arrangements}
An arrangement (or list or string) is a (finite) sequence of items in which the order of the items in the sequence matters.

The length of an arrangement is the number of items in the sequence.

\textbf{Multiplication Principle}. for an arrangement of length $k$, if for $i \in \{1,\,2,\,\dotsc,\,k\}$ there are $n_i$ choices for the $i$th item, regardless of previous choices, then the number of possible arrangements is $n_1n_2\dotsi n_k$.

\subsection{Permutations}
A permutation on a finite set $S$ is an arrangement of length $|S|$ that uses each item from $S$ exactly once.

\begin{proposition}
    If $|S| = n$, then there are $n!$ permutations on $S$.
    
    \begin{proof}
        $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\dotsi 2 \cdot 1 = n!$\footnote{This is standard problem \#2 (no repeats) with $n = k$.}
    \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

We can generalise this concept. For a non-negative integer $r$, an $r$-permutation on $S$ is an arrangement of $r$ distinct elements from $S$.

We write $P(n,\,r)$ for the number of $r$-permutations on a set of size $n$.
\[
P(n, r) = n(n - 1)\dotsi (n - r + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}, \text{ for } 0 \leq r \leq n.
\]

\subsection{Counting examples}

\textbf{Addition Principle}. Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite sets that are disjoint, i.e. $A \cap B = \emptyset$. Then
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|.
\]
More generally, if $A_1,\,A_2,\,\dotsc,\,A_n$ are pairwise disjoint, meaning that $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$, then
\[
|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dotsi \cup A_n| = |A_1| + |A_2| + \dotsi + |A_n|.
\]
