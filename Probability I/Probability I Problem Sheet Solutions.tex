\begin{problem}[35]
    Find the probability that in a family of six children, the second child is a girl but they are not all girls (assuming all outcomes are equally likely)
    
    \begin{proof}[Solution]\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}
        Let $\P(A)$ be the probability that all children are girls and let $\P(B)$ be the probability that the second child is a girl.

        Here we can see that there are $2 ^ 6$ different possibilities hence we can apply classical probability and the definition of equally likely outcomes to see that
        \[
        \P{B} = \frac{1}{2 ^ 6} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2 ^ 6}\quad\text{since there is only one possibility that they are all girls.}
        \]
        Similarly
        \[
        \P{A} = \frac{1}{2 ^ 6} \cdot (2 ^ 6 - 2 ^ 5) = \frac{2 ^ 6 - 2 ^  5}{2 ^ 6}\quad\text{since there are $2 ^ 6 - 2 ^ 5$ number of possibilities where the second child is a girl.}
        \]
        Using these facts we can then apply C1 to obtain an expression for the probability of the event that the second child is a girl but they are not all girls
        \begin{align*}
            \P(A \setminus B) &= \P(A) - \P(A \cap B) \\
            &= \frac{2 ^ 6 - 2 ^ 5}{2 ^ 6} - \frac{1}{2 ^ 6} \cdot \frac{2 ^ 6 - 2 ^ 5}{2 ^ 6} \\
            &= \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2 ^ 6}\right) \\
            &= \frac{2 ^ 6 - 1}{2 ^ 7}.
        \end{align*}
        This gives us the final probability of $\dfrac{2 ^ 6 - 1}{2 ^ 7}$.
    \end{proof}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[68]
    Show that if $A$ and $B$ are independent,
    then $A$ and $B ^ c$ are also independent.
    \begin{proof}
        We know that
        \begin{equation}
            \P(A \cap B) = \P(A)\P(B).
        \end{equation}

        We have to show that $\P(A \cap B ^ c) = \P(A)\P(B ^ c)$.

        Observe that $A = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap B ^ c)$,
        so $\P(A) \overset{A3}{=} \P(A \cap B) + \P(A \cap B ^ c)$,
        since $(A \cap B) \cap (A \cap B ^ c) = \emptyset$

        Using (1), we get
        \[
        \P(A) = \P(A)\P(B) + \P(A \cap B ^ c)
        \]
        or,
        \begin{align*}
            \P(A \cap B ^ c) &= \P(A) - \P(A)\P(B) \\
            &= \P(A)\underbrace{\left[1 - \P(B)\right]}_{= \P(B ^ c)} \\
            &= \P(A)\P(B ^ c).
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
\end{problem}
